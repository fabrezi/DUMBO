## Problem Statment

The task is to simply read data from an excel file and display it in a Web-UI (website).

The file can have two colums. Name and age. The task is to extract the information and display.


## Solution

Setup a NodeJS server can be used as to spin up the display. As it is a static site, it wont require much implementation. 

The UI is said to require React. This will be an enabler in order to understand what it is and how to use it for the problem at hand.

The Model-View-Controller method can be applied.
