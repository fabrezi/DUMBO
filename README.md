# Documentation

DUMBO is primarily designed to tackle the problem of `user-desired-task`. This is much different then a `user-defined-task`. one difference is that the former is dynamic while the other is static. 

We want to design an API that can dynamically solve an issue of arbitary complexity and wide range of issues. These can range from communication channels, send a picture, make a joke, write an excuse etc. DUMBO is basically a servant ready to serve the user --master. The old fashioned master-slave architecture can be applied. Though the nomencalture of `user-deisred-task` is new but the idea is old as time.

More then anything DUMBO is a test app, ready to take a request and perform an event.
