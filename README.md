# Documentation

DUMBO is primarily designed to tackle the problem of `user-desired-task`. This is much different then a `user-defined-task`. one difference is that the former is dynamic while the other is static. 

We want to design an API that can dynamically solve an issue of arbitrary complexity and wide range of issues. These can range from communication channels, send a picture, make a joke, write an excuse etc. DUMBO is basically a servant ready to serve the user --master. The old fashioned master-slave architecture can be applied. Though the nomencalture of `user-deisred-task` is new but the idea is old as time.

More than anything DUMBO is a test app, ready to take a request and perform an event. 

The purpose of this exercise is primarily to test the functionality of the backend and frontend. The exercise will expand as the levels are completed. The final look or feel of the API is to be 
a service based app. It will perform the required task as the user specify. 

The tech stack will be: Spring, Hibernate, PG, and AngularJS.

The following are the open task:

[1] Create a GET HTTP method which sends back a funny response.
[2] Send a message and save it in the database.
[3] Generate Hexadecimal code/ UUID.

# Setup

- Configure the Spring framework.
